Why oops is not supported multiple inheritance.

1. One problem occurs when two parent classes have data members or methods of the same name. It is difficult to resolve which is being referenced by the sub-class.
2. The Diamond of Dread:
   We have a class A, then B and C both inherit from A. And someone then decides that D must inherit both from B and C.
   The parent class A was present twice in its grandchild class D, having something go silently wrong and crash.
